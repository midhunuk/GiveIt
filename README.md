# GiveIt
Its a card game.
This is a game I played during my childhood days. I don't remember the name of the game :)

The rules of the game are simple.
The cards are shuffle and equally distributed among the players.
One player is selected by toss for call.
The selected player calls a attribute from the card top most of his\her deck.
All other players compare the same attribute from there top most card in their deck.
The player with most\least value depending on the attribute gets all the cards and becomes the caller.
and the game is continued till one player remains.
